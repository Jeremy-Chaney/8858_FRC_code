# Team 8858's Scouting Template

In this directory is an example template of where we paste data generated by [QRScout](http://frc2713.github.io/QRScout) from [Team 2713 Red Hawk Robotics](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/2713)

Raw data can be added to the 'Raw Data' Page on QRScout Parsing Sheet Template.xlsx, then entering a team number into cell C2 on 'Analysis Sheet', the excel sheet will parse out stats for this team from the data entered by scouts.
